# Girls4Change: The chatbot to pave her future

This is built during a 1-night hackathon CHIMEHACK4. Our submission page, containing a demo video, is available @ https://devpost.com/software/girls4change.

We want to bring community-driven education amongst refugee girls through the Facebook platform. Refugee girls would inform the Facebook Messenger chatbot of their education status, educational needs and aspirations, and the chatbot would link up users with similar profiles and learning interests to form virtual communities as Facebook groups, each focused on mutual learning and sharing of educational resources for a specific domain (e.g. Conversational English for Grade 1-3).

This is an ExpressJS app which would accept Facebook Messenger calls through webhooks, and it simulates a chatbot backed by a trained API.AI agent specific to this use case.
